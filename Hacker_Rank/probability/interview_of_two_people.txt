Bill and Nina appear for an interview for two vacancies. The probability of Bill’s selection is 1/3 and that of
Nina’s selection is 1/5. Find the probability that only one of them will be selected.

Bill    Nina
Y       N
N       Y

Bill    Nina
1/3  *  4/5    = 4/15
2/3  *  1/5    = 2/15

= 6/15
= 2/5
