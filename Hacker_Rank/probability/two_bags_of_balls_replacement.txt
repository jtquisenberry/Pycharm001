Bag X contains 5 white balls and 4 black balls.
Bag Y contains 7 white balls and 6 black balls.
You draw 1 ball from bag X and, without observing its color, put it into bag Y.
Now, if a ball is drawn from bag Y, find the probability that it is black.

X
W     B
5/9   4/9

Y =

Composition A
5/9 probability of composition
W     B
8/14  6/14

Composition B
4/9 probability of composition
W     B
7/14  7/14

5/9 * 6/14 + 4/9 * 7/14
= 30/126 + 28/126
= 58/126
= 29/63
