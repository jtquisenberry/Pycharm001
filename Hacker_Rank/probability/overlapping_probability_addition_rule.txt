Task
In a certain city, the probability of a resident not reading the morning newspaper is 1/2,
and the probability of a resident not reading the evening newspaper is 2/5.
The probability they will read both newspapers is .

Find the probability that a resident reads a morning or evening newspaper.

Reads Morning = 1/2
Reads Evening = 3/5
Reads Both = 1/5

P(A ∩ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∪ B)
= 1/2 + 3/5 - 1/5
= 5/10 + 6/10 - 2/10
= 9/10
