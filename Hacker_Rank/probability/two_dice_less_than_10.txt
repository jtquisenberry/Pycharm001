Objective
In this challenge, we practice calculating probability.

Task
In a single toss of fair (evenly-weighted) -sided dice, find the probability of that their sum will be at most 9.

        Die 1    Die 2
P(10) = 3/6   *  1/6
P(11) = 2/6   *  1/6
P(12) = 1/6   *  1/6

P(10 ∪ 11 ∪ 12)
= P(9) + P(10) + P(11) + P(12)
= 6/36 = 1/6

P(~(10 ∪ 11 ∪ 12))
= 1 - P(10 ∪ 11 ∪ 12)
= 5/6
