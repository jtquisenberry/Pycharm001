A firm produces steel pipes in three plants.

    Plant A produces 500 units per day and has a fraction defective output of 0.005.
    Plant B produces 1000 units per day and has a fraction defective output of 0.008.
    Plant C produces 2000 units per day and has a fraction defective output of 0.010.

At random, a pipe is selected from the dayâ€™s total production and it is found to be
defective. What is the probability that it came from plant A?

Expected Defective Pipes

A = 500  * .005 = 2.5
B = 1000 * .008 = 8
C = 2000 * .010 = 20

Contribution by A to all pipes = 2.5 / (2.5 + 8 + 20)
= 2.5/30.5
= 5/61
