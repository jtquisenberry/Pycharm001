P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B)
         --------
         P(B)

         Note that P(A ∩ B) depends on whether A and B are independent.

Let
* D  = having a disease
* T+ = testing positive

         Test Result
Truth    POS   NEG   Total
Disease  44    23    67
Healthy  10    60    70
Total    54    83    137

P(D|T+) = P(D ∩ T+)
          ---------
          P(T+)
