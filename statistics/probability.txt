Independent Events
P(A âˆ© B ) = P(A) * P(B)

Task
Bag 1 contains 4 red balls and 5 black balls.
Bag 2 contains 3 red balls and 7 black balls.
One ball is drawn from Bag 1 , and two balls are drawn from Bag 2.
Find the probability that two balls are black and one ball is red.

Option 1: P(A) 5/9 * 7/10 * 2/9
Option 2: 4/9 * 
P(~A) = 4/9
P(B) = 7/10 * 6/9
