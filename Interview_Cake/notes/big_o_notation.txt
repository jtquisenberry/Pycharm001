Hash List is technically
Search = O(n), Insertion = O(n), Deletion = O(n)
because there can be hash collisions.
The amortized complexity is O(1)

ARRAY (STATIC)
 	    Worst Case
space 	O(n)
lookup 	O(1)
append 	O(1)
insert 	O(n)
delete 	O(n)

ARRAY SLICING
O(n) time
O(n) space

DYNAMIC ARRAY

        Average Worst Case
space 	O(n) 	O(n)
lookup 	O(1) 	O(1)
append 	O(1) 	O(n)
insert 	O(n) 	O(n)
delete 	O(n) 	O(n)

The append worst case of O(n) may occur with resizing.
